",COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,Bachelor of Science in Biology,"Mount Palay-palay Mataas na Gulod Protected Landscape had experienced overexploitation, deforestation and land degradation before it was declared as a protected landscape. The Philippine government had been continuously exerting their efforts in monitoring the protected areas’ status; however, few accounts of the association of physicochemical and environmental factors to tree species diversity were recorded. The study specifically aimed to assess the plant diversity and ecology of the NE slope of MPMNGPL. Variables such as physicochemical, site and environmental factors were taken on 2 transects consisting of 10 nested plots each measuring 10x10m with 40m interval. Plant data from the plots revealed that there are 67 plant species wherein 66 are native and 1 is non-native which is Paspalum conjugatum and Sapindales is the most dominant order. NPK values are affected by soil pH as soil moisture is to relative humidity and canopy cover. Elevation is inversely proportional (p<0.05) to the distance of trees, DBH and species richness. However, using Pearson — correlation, the study shows an insignificant relationship (p<0.05) between physicochemical factors and species diversity in MPMNGPL. Therefore, according to the results of the data analysis, the physicochemical properties which served as parameters of this research do not have a significant relationship with plant diversity because MPMNGPL different rehabilitation programs and is not a virgin forest anymore.",Keywords : Mount Palay-palay; Cavite Protected Landscape; Southern Luzon; DENR; Plant diversity; Physicochemical Factors,May 2019

Liquefaction is a phenomena, in which, when a certain layer of soil is subjected to rapid or cyclic loading usually induced by earthquakes, the stiffness and bond strength in soil particles tend to decrease and when the saturated soil experience the shaking the initially low water pressure starts to gradually increase up to the point where the soil particles move with respect to each other. Initial assessment for the potential liquefaction was done through certain variables already present. The variable included in the initial assessment is the liquefaction hazard map provided by the partnership of Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) - DOST and focal government of the province of Cavite. The proximity of the said location to the nearest fault lines is also considered. The valley fault system also commonly known as west valley fault, considered as one of the potential dangerous active fault at present. It has a segment that extends from Dingalan, Aurora up to Canlubang, Laguna and passes through certain areas of Cavite. With this condition presented, the proximity of Tanza National Comprehensive high School to the said active fault is a factor. The assessment is further analyzed with the aid of soil test conducted with the soil samples from the site and the boring logs provided by Department of Public Works and Highways — Cavite I District Engineering Office. The parameters for the assessment of potential liquefaction is gathered and analyzed using Seed and Idriss simplified procedure in assessing potential liquefaction. Therefore the researchers found out that the Tanza National Comprehensive High School (TNCHS) is susceptible to liquefaction having a layer of Silty clay type soil within the Ground Water Table adheres potential liquefaction. The mitigation procedure conducted is soil stabilization by chemical method using Lime-Silica fume additives. There are various researches and studies that proved the effectiveness of Lime as stabilizing agent. Furthermore, Silica fume is a pozzolan which means that there is no cementitious property, the mixture is water insoluble which it does not dissolve in the presence of water. This chemical reaction creates a compound that is gel like that tends to bind lumps in soil particles. This process tends to improve the condition of soil and shows improvements to the parameters compared with the untreated sample.","Keywords: Potential Liquefaction, Chemical stabilization, Sced and Idriss, Lime, Silica Proximity to faults, Hazard Map",January 2017

Saquilayan,COLLEGE OF ALLIED MEDICAL SCIENCES,Bachelor of Science in Biology,"Plastic pollution poses a threat to environmental sustainability, necessitating innovative solutions for its mitigation. This comparative study investigated the biodegradation capabilities of two beetle larvae species, Tenebrio molitor (mealworms) and (superworms), focusing on their consumption of polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP). Over 12-day experimental period, their larvae were observed under controlled conditions to determine their plastic consumption efficiency. Tenebrio molitor and Zophobas atratus were each divided into three groups, with triplicate samples for each type of plastic: PE, PS, and PP. The study compared the consumption rates of plastics by the larvae. Results showed notable discrepancies in biodegradation abilities between the two species Superworms exhibited higher consumption rates of polystyrene polypropylene (0.40 g), and polyethylene (0.33 g) compared to mealworms, which consumed polystyrene (1.20 g), polypropylene (0.27 g), and polyethylene (0.30 g). The survival rates of both species are similar across various plastic types, except in the case of polypropylene consumption, where Tenebrio molitor exhibited a significantly lower survival rate compared to Zophobas atratus. The research confirms that both mealworms and superworms are effective in aiding plastic waste management Their ability to break down various types of plastics demonstrates their significance as a natural solution for combating plastic pollution.","Keywords: Biodegradation, Polystyrene (PS), Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene (PP), Tenebrio molitor (mealworms), Zophobas atratus (superworms)",June 2024

In this study an attempt has been made to find the suitability of the plastic wastes as a possible replacement for cement to act as a binder for coarse aggregates in making bricks for road pavements. The study was conducted to determine certain proportion of plastic waste with coarse that will give a highest compressive strength upon bricks making. This experimental study deals with the characterization of plastic waste aggregates and compare with cement coarse aggregate, the study of the behavior fresh and hardened concrete bricks compare with plastic waste coarse aggregate bricks and lastly the investigation of the best proportion of plastic waste and sand to be able to get the most convenient bricks. To do so, first, the classification of plastic waste is measured and then cut into small piece so that it can be melt properly; they were used as a substitute for cement with a plastic waste and sand ratio of 40:60, 50:50, and 60:40 percent using 5 types of plastic waste like PET, HPDE, LPDE, PP and PVC. Besides, all other parameters are equal. Finally Strength and Water Absorption of the sample bricks were observed. The findings revealed that generally using plastic waste as to act as a binder for coarse aggregates in replacement for cement lead reduce the waste and also it is cheaper compared to the normal bricks. The 40:60 PET plastic is the best proportion according to the results of its compressive strength.","Keywords: Plastic waste, Coarse Aggregates, Concrete, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP and PVC",October 2015

154,LYCEUM OF THE PHILIPPINES UNIVERSITY CAVITE COLLEGE STUDENTS' BRAND PREFERENCE: BENCH VS. PENSHOPPE,KRISTINE GRACE A. ALVARADO PAMELA PIA M. CARRILLO JESSA E. CHAVEZ PAMELA GUIAN S. MARANION NICOLE O. POMOY,COLLEGE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION,Bachelor of Science in Business Administration,"The main purpose of this research study entitled Lyceum of the Philippines University Cavite College Students' Brand Preference: Bench vs. Penshoppe was to determine what apparel brand (Bench and Penshoppe) is preferred more by the college students of LPU-Cavite. The participants of the study were the equally divided number of students from different college departments who have owned or purchased apparels from both brands, and it includes the following: College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), College of Allied and Medical Sciences (CAMS), College of Business Administration (CBA), College of International Tourism and Hospitality Management (CITHM), and College of Engineering, Computer Studies and Architecture (COECSA). Among the participants, there are more students who preferred Bench. The study showed that there are more Bench participants who are in the age bracket of 16 to 18 years. There are more female participants for Bench from CAMS and CITHM. Lastly, most of them purchases clothes once a month. For Penshoppe participants, there are more participants, who are in the age bracket of 16 to 18. More of the participants are male from CAMS. Majority of the Penshoppe participants purchase clothes once a month The research aimed to determine the brand between Bench and Penshoppe that is being preferred more by the students, and to know how brand was perceived by the participants through its brand equity, a brand concept that affects the brand preference of a customer. The result of the study from Bench participants showed that they perceived Bench most as apparel brand that is attractive and stylish as it was ranked first on the factors of brand equity. As for Penshoppe participants, they also perceived it most as apparel brand that is attractive and stylish, because they ranked it first on the factors of brand equity. Overall, Bench is the most preferred brand by the students and got almost the same but higher average mean than Penshoppe in terms of brand equity which means that Bench is a stronger brand compared to Penshoppe. Determining participants' brand perception using the concept of brand equity played an important role in influencing the customers' brand preference. The brand that has stronger brand equity will win the market. Based on the conclusions, the researchers hereby recommend the following: 1. Bench and Penshoppe should focus on adapting the needs of teenagers since most of the brand customers are from the age bracket of 16-18. Teens are obviously known as trend-setters, so both brands should keep an eye on designing products specifically for teens or directed toward young people. This is because teens have persistent attitude and growing hunger for newest luxury items including clothe apparel. 2. Most of the participants buy clothes once a month maybe due to their limited budget or new set of clothes available in the store. This is why Bench and Penshoppe should think of some promotions may be through sales discounts so that customers; despite of limited budget would be attracted to buy their products with much lower prices. Also, updating their products regularly is essential since customers will likely to buy clothes when there is a new set of designs. 3. Based on results, Penshoppe was the less preferred brand by the students and got almost the same but lower average mean than Bench. To increase the level of brand preference of Penshoppe, they must continue to look for ways to improve their product features, pricing, distribution strategy, customization, customer service and support. Since customers were strongly affected by advertising, Bench and Penshoppe should use strong advertising strategy that will also help increase brand increase positive brand perception. Like advertising through social media or online advertising, use of foreign and local celebrity endorsers, increase visibility of your product to a wider range of customers. 4. Conducting surveys from a wide range of participants can also be essential to obtain better results. Location can also affect results of the study. Bench, being the preferred brand of LPU-Cavite college students may not be the most preferred brand from other school. It would help if they would conduct surveys from participants of different location. A little range of participants would result to minimal or limited information a research can have.",,March 2016

The researchers used qualitative-comparative research with standardized interview and assessment to gather data from the responses of the key informants at the conduct of the study. Prominent political analysts, Mr. Edmund Tayao and Mr. Ramon Casiple; local government official from the Municipality of Magallanes, Cavite, Ms. Aina Sisante; former professor in University of the Philippines — Visayas, Mr. Hanibal Camua; a Dean of the University of the Philippines National College of Public Administration, Mr. Alex Brillantes; and a national elected official, Senator Pia Cayetano. The results show that the Philippines, under a Unitary government is very highly centralized, and in theory, is not suited for the needs of a diverse country like ours. Changing our system to a Federal system, would empower the local governments which would be a key to standardization in order to meet the basic needs of the people, making it easier for the people to get their needs because the people will be grouped in accordance to their culture and behavior. Hence, a federal government has a bigger probability of fostering good governance compared to unilateral but with the minimum percentage and possibility. But, it’s not the sole solution to everything. Changing the morale and values of the Filipino people should also be given utmost consideration for us to further promote and foster good governance in our country.","Keywords: Unitary System, Model Federal System, Good Governance",March 2016

Governments all across the globe grappled with the present resources to curb the spread of the disease by closing down entire economic sectors and imposing widespread restrictions on mobility. This condition has evolved into a major economic crisis which has burdened local businesses. In this study, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on Tagaytay City's local business particularly on the losses as well as the interventions were examined. Anchoring on the Organizational Adaptation Theory of Podsakoff and MacKenzie (2016), the researcher utilized a qualitative research design to gather data from 10 purposely selected participants who were respective owners of local businesses in Tagaytay. Using the methodological approach of Thomas (2006), the findings revealed that there were notable losses due to the decline in tourism and travel which used to be one of the main sources of income in the city. Furthermore, there was also a significant decrease in the number of customers serviced by different industries; not only due to the imposed lockdown restrictions but also partly in fear of the health risks of acquiring the infection. Hence, the local business had to employ a skeletal workforce and reduce operation hours. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to significant income losses which led businesses to financial stagnation, net deficit, or even bankruptcy and eventual closure. As a result of the study, businesses are recommended to take advantage of e- commerce, as investing in this would considerably assist businesses in recovering since consumers have high preference of online transactions today. Finally, a comprehensive information platform should be implemented by the government to assist individuals who remain unemployed and are still job looking.","Keywords: COVID-19, Local Business",December 2021

Although conducting the survey was difficult due to data privacy concerns, respondents were given sufficient assurance that any information they provided would be used solely for the purpose of the study. The goal of this study is to better promote the Foreign Service program and to expose them to more opportunities outside of the university; this allows students and program enrollment to grow. Furthermore, the goal of this study is to serve as a foundation for future researchers and a reference for future research.","Keywords: CoViD - 19 Pandemic, Foreign Service Students, HR Managers, BPO Industry",December 2022

VICEDO,COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service,"This thesis explores how the Balikatan joint exercises series between the Republic of the Philippines and the United States contribute to the enhancement of the Philippine Maritime Security by analyzing literatures relevant to the study and conducting interviews with people who have credible understanding about the issue. The Balikatan series of military exercises is a bilateral Philippines-U.S annual event aimed at improving Republic of the Philippines - United States combined planning, combat readiness and interoperability while enhancing security relations. Through the Balikatan exercises, the U.S. has provided assistance related to enhancing Philippine military capabilities and competencies. It is not the Balikatan exercise series that greatly contribute to the enhancement of Philippines' Maritime Security but the relationship with the US that increases the Philippines' sense of security over our maritime issues. Furthermore, with the United States being the dominant naval power, viewed from the Philippines' perspective, the Philippines do need the support of the US in terms of naval security. In view of these outcomes, this thesis asks how future Balikatan exercises may be conducted in order to contribute to a not just the Maritime Security of the Philippines. This thesis argues that the RP-US Balikatan exercise series can be a tool in improving and enhancing the Maritime security of the Philippines by means of professionalizing and enhancing the capability of the Armed Forces of the Philippines specifically the Philippine Navy and Marine Corp.","Keywords: Balikatan Exercises, Maritime Security",March 2016

The purpose of this research is to determine the overarching reasons why most of the Philippine Navy officers optionally retire in the active military service despite the good remunerations, benefits and lots of things it offers for the morale and welfare of its officers. The descriptive method was used in this study and survey questionnaires were circulated to the optionally retired regular and reserved officers composed of 56 respondents who after retirement reside in the vicinities of Cavite and Manila areas. The results of the study show that they had no unilateral reasons why they optionally retired from the military service despite the great perks other than the primary factors which gave them primary level of career satisfaction which is salary.

Based on the survey, their career satisfaction which was primarily attributed to their salary primarily affected their reason to leave the organization early.

Hence, it can be concluded that the officers retire from the service earlier because of entities outside which they think can utilize their capabilities at maximum level with commensurate compensation compared to that which is within the organization. It is recommended that the younger officers, early in their military profession should have an outlook for their career and condition their minds in doing so because it is their career and a lifetime profession. The institution should always find ways to give attention to its officers and soldiers for their satisfaction. The unit commanders in the area should give professional advice to their younger officers regarding commitment in the service despite the prevalence of good alternative working condition outside the Philippine Navy.

RECTO ACADEMY OF ADVANCED STUDIES,Doctor of Philosophy in Business Management,"Taking the regional food industry cluster as the research object, this paper constructs the theoretical framework of innovation ability governance suitable for the dynamic competition and cooperation background and puts forward the hypothesis model of governance mechanism based on transaction and relationship governance. The five- point Likert questionnaire was used to collect the perceptual data of innovation ability, relationship governance, transaction governance and competition and cooperation intensity of 121 member units. The MPLUS software was utilized to test the hypothesis model to measure the relationship, convergence validity, global fit and robustness. The latent adjustment structural equation (LMS ) method was employed to analyze the potential interaction between competition and cooperation intensity, governance mechanism and innovation ability. The effect of four groups of governance mechanisms on innovation capability is dynamically compared. Results showed that the improvement of regional industrial cluster innovation ability depends on the rational use of relationship governance and transaction governance under different co-opetition intensities. When the internal co-opetition intensity is low, the composite mechanism of ' high level transaction governance-low level relationship governance ' is the best configuration scheme. When the internal co-opetition intensity is high, the Council should implement more high-level relationship governance, and the composite mechanism of ' high level relationship governance-transaction governance is the best configuration scheme.","Keywords. industrial cluster, competitive cooperation, latent adjustment structural equation, innovation ability, value creation",October 2022

In terms of educational attainment, 56 percent of the participants are college graduates. 81 percent of the participants are employed, and 19 percent are self- employed. In terms of monthly income, 32 percent of the participants belong to the income group of The average score accumulated by participants in cooperative knowledge is 7.38, or below average. Cooperative members got an average rating, while non-members mounted up to below average. As to their level of awareness of cooperatives, participants in general were assessed as having moderate awareness of the factors identified. Categorizing the Participant groups, cooperative members were assessed as being extremely aware and non-members as being moderately aware of cooperatives. Findings in marketing and recruitment suggest that cooperative marketing and recruitment activities are often perceived as cooperative by the participants. Cooperative member participants often observe marketing and recruitment, while non-members rarely observe marketing and recruitment. The result of the binary logistic regression reveals that knowledge, level of awareness, age, educational attainment, and monthly income are significantly related to cooperative membership, whereas gender, employment status, and marketing and recruitment are not significantly related to cooperative membership. Notably, the level of awareness has the highest positive impact on cooperative membership. The odds ratio also revealed that the level of awareness increased, for individuals who had a higher level of awareness about approximately by 1,300 cooperatives.
