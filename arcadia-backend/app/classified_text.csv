data_1.jpg,,,,,,,,,,"Emmelyn R.  Carilla, and Research",Abstract,"The purpose of this study was to explore how Candy Magazine transitioned from print to digital. The study sought to explain how the selected magazine adjusted from challenges faced by the company, the changes in the organizational structure and the how the company surpassed management challenges experienced in the amidst of digitalization. The study adopted a theory based on Thorstein Veblen’s Technological Determinism, which suggests the impact of the technology to the human behavior and thought. The researchers utilized a qualitative method in the study. For the specific research method, the researchers adopted the approach of case study. The researchers chose participants from Summit Media to answer questions to the research problem. The participants were interviewed using in- depth, open ended questions. The results show that there is a tedious process in creating a printed magazine that includes departments with different functions to publish it. In managing a magazine, the Marketing department is in charge of retaining audiences. The study shows that there are challenges faced by Candy Magazine. These challenges include; how audiences consume content, social media platforms that are big players, new formats that audiences patronize and new marketing strategies. A digital magazine utilizes parallel organization that has a 24/7 system ready to publish relevant contents. Digital magazines collate their audiences to gain readership. Results revealed transitioning to digital using social media will broaden their audiences and emerging with new platforms could possibly gain audiences, It can be concluded that Candy Magazine had transitioned from print to digital by accepting internet trends, exploring new formats, utilizing social media platforms and changing their aesthetics to what generation they cater to. It is recommended that future publication must learn digital strategies and techniques to increase their audiences. For print magazines who are thriving in the digital age, it is recommended to utilize platforms that may encourage possible target audience but still stay true to their magazine’s purpose to retain the audience they have in print.",College of Arts and Sciences,"Keywords: Digitalization, Social First, Magazines, Medium Shift",,

data_11.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,"Mount Palay-palay Mataas na Gulod Protected Landscape had experienced overexploitation, deforestation and land degradation before it was declared as a protected landscape. The Philippine government had been continuously exerting their efforts in monitoring the protected areas’ status; however, few accounts of the association of physicochemical and environmental factors to tree species diversity were recorded. The study specifically aimed to assess the plant diversity and ecology of the NE slope of MPMNGPL. Variables such as physicochemical, site and environmental factors were taken on 2 transects consisting of 10 nested plots each measuring 10x10m with 40m interval. Plant data from the plots revealed that there are 67 plant species wherein 66 are native and 1 is non-native which is Paspalum conjugatum and Sapindales is the most dominant order. NPK values are affected by soil pH as soil moisture is to relative humidity and canopy cover. Elevation is inversely proportional (p<0.05) to the distance of trees, DBH and species richness. However, using Pearson — correlation, the study shows an insignificant relationship (p<0.05) between physicochemical factors and species diversity in MPMNGPL. Therefore, according to the results of the data analysis, the physicochemical properties which served as parameters of this research do not have a significant relationship with plant diversity because MPMNGPL different rehabilitation programs and is not a virgin forest anymore.",College of Arts and Sciences,Keywords : Mount Palay-palay; Cavite Protected Landscape; Southern Luzon; DENR; Plant diversity; Physicochemical Factors,,

data_141.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,ABSTRACT,"textile in the modern era of Philippine fashion. Handloom weaving is a significant tradition that embodies the spiritual beliefs of many indigenous tribes in the Philippines. In the modern era, most Filipinos generally follow popular fashion trends that are derived from foreign influences; therefore, many Filipinos are unaware of our locally and culturally made products and garments. This study is heavily reliant on the insights and answers of the expert participants. The researchers were able to interview Mr. Michael Angelo Yambok, head of the T’boli cluster of the NCCA Subcommission on Communities and Traditional Arts and the president of Lake Sebu’s Cultural Workers Association; Mr. Dante Mana, fashion designer and owner of Durante Clothing; and Mr. RL fashion designer and owner of Estelu by RL Omadle. Ultimately, the researchers concluded that the importance of the T’boli tribe’s T’nalak weave towards the modem era of Philippine fashion is that the indigenous textiles, specifically the Tnalak, possess a huge role in providing livelihoods to the T’boli community; cultural awareness in regards to the T’nalak textile and the traditions it is vital to conserving our Philippine indigenous heritage; and utilizing the T’nalak textile appropriately to modern attire helps in the promotion and recognition of the indigenous community.",College of Fine Arts and Design,"Keywords: T’boli tribe, T’nalak, Indigenous textiles, Fashion Design, Modem Fashion",,

Water recycling is a beautiful and convenient process. However, it is not well- accepted and well-known among the students of laboratory classes. Thus the proponents developed an improved water system using gravimetric and neutralization process in ad- dition to reverse osmosis filtration with ultraviolet lights. Input water consisting of oil and soap was used in the procedure. The process and testing yielded an oil-free and clear output water with acceptable pH level but cannot be drink.

Researchers employed mixed method by using the Exploratory Sequential Design in which the researchers followed the sequence of gathering necessary data through archives and interview conducted to five participants — DOST chief of staff, Tagaytay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council officer in charge, barangay kagawad, barangay treasurer and barangay secretary, before survey took place in Barangay Kaybagal, Tagaytay City. The results show that Barangay Kaybagal residents were informed and educated by the local government units about the S4SC campaign using the strategies of the DOST. Thus, it can be concluded that communication plan applied in the campaign dissemination is effective since the residents are still aware and applying the learnings from the campaign even after it ended. It is suggested that communication plan proposal must be made when planning to launch a campaign or program to have the desire effect.",College of Arts and Sciences,"Keywords: Campaign Dissemination, Communication Plan, Effectiveness, Science for Safer Communities",,

Qualitative method was used in the study and interview was conducted to four participants: a screenwriter-filmmaker, a novelist, an independent film director and a film instructor. The researchers also employed the historical approach. This approach aimed to show how the independent films in the Philippines have changed. The interview supports the various literatures that have been studied by the researchers. The results show that the advent of digital technology and the pursuit of art caused the emergence of independent films, and the continuing technological development and the increase of audience contributes to the flourishing of independent films.

On the other hand, full-time CBA faculty members identified the 12 workplace stressors as only “slightly stressful”. It can be concluded the part-time faculty members experienced higher workplace stressors compared to the full-time CBA faculty members. Fuli-time CBA faculty members employ more coping mechanisms to manage workplace stressors as supported by more coping mechanisms “used a great deal” by full-time than part-time CBA faculty members.

The study was conducted to determine certain proportion of plastic waste with coarse that will give a highest compressive strength upon bricks making. This experimental study deals with the characterization of plastic waste aggregates and compare with cement coarse aggregate, the study of the behavior fresh and hardened concrete bricks compare with plastic waste coarse aggregate bricks and lastly the investigation of the best proportion of plastic waste and sand to be able to get the most convenient bricks. To do so, first, the classification of plastic waste is measured and then cut into small piece so that it can be melt properly; they were used as a substitute for cement with a plastic waste and sand ratio of 40:60, 50:50, and 60:40 percent using 5 types of plastic waste like PET, HPDE, LPDE, PP and PVC. Besides, all other parameters are equal. Finally Strength and Water Absorption of the sample bricks were observed. The findings revealed that generally using plastic waste as to act as a binder for coarse aggregates in replacement for cement lead reduce the waste and also it is cheaper compared to the normal bricks. The 40:60 PET plastic is the best proportion according to the results of its compressive strength.","COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, COMPUTER STUDIES AND ARCHITECTURE","Keywords: Plastic waste, Coarse Aggregates, Concrete, PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP and PVC",,

Roof insulation will reduce the amount of sun's radiant heat that penetrate in summer up to 97% and also render better thermal protection in colder in winter. Effective temperature insulation material preserve the convective heat inside in the winter and creates warmer atmosphere. There are existing commercial insulator such as wood fiber, perlite, polyisocyanurate, polystyrene, cellular and gypsum board.Bananas are today grown in every humid tropical region and constitute the 4th largest fruit crop of the world. Bananas have many use but considering the amount of banana waste in the Philippines still there is a lot wasted from banana trees. The Pseudostem is the part of the banana plant that looks like a trunk. It is formed by the tightly packed overlapping Also Pseudostem is not only a major agricultural waste that will be found in the field. Otherwise, it is also a big benefit to our country, because our country is also tropical and hotter compare to other main objective of this study is to use the Dried Pseudostem as a Roof Insulating Material and compare to other insulator like polystyrene because of its demand and popularity. Thermal test is the actual exposure of the pseudostem sheets insulator under the heat of the sun place in the top of the ceiling of a down scaled house to make it more realistic. The investigation is done by using a digital thermometer measure the temperature of the air inside the specimen.

At present, there were traffic signals installed in the intersection but it was not being used due to technical errors. The researchers aim to compare the status of the unsignalized intersection with the signalized using PTV Vissim Traffic Simulator. Using Webster Method, traffic signal cycles were formulated and then plugged-in to the software. Simulation runs were made and gathered data from using the 75-second cycle length derived from the computations. Each approach from the four-legged intersection was analyzed, and it was found out that keeping the intersection unsignalized yield better results than the signalized in terms of average queue length, average queue delay, and level of service.

Manual monitoring of the construction activities are time and work consuming, also error prone. A recent investigation indicated that there is a lack of systematic and automated evaluation and monitoring in some construction projects. The aim of this study is to present a system that can be used in the construction industry for monitoring and evaluating the physical progress, and also to establish how current computer technology can be utilized for monitoring the actual physical progress at the construction site. This study discusses the results of questionnaire survey conducted and suggests a prototype system, namely ArkCivilis. The ArkCivilis monitoring system integrates the information from construction site progress and planned schedule of work. Using emerging technologies and information system, ArkCivilis re-engineers the traditional practice for monitoring project progresses. The application of this system enables project management teams to better track and control the productivity and quality of construction projects. Also, the use of ArkCivilis monitoring can help resident engineers, construction managers and site engineers in monitoring and evaluating project performance. This model will improve decision-making process and provide better mechanism for advanced project management.","COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, COMPUTER STUDIES AND ARCHITECTURE","Keywords: Construction Management, Monitoring System, and Estimate",,

The purpose of this research is to develop the “Serville — Ana’s Resort.” From the data that will be gathered from surveys and questionnaires, the researchers will be able to know the perception of people about the resort and know what amenities to add and improve. The outcome will increase the profit of the resort and the number of visitors during off seasons. The number of people will likely dwindle down as expected during off season or from July to December. The aim of the researchers is to find out solutions for the resort to be profitable during this period of the year. Upon the observation and analysis of data from survey questionnaire, researchers found out that there are certain occasions which people visit the resort during off season. Family gathering/reunions and social gatherings are the common answers of the participants while school activities and receptions for weddings/christenings are not far behind. This shows that there are possible ways of increasing the profit by having or developing the facilities of the resort for these occasions. The usual companions of customers are also critical to know what kind of amenities to develop. The most common are friends and families. Others are classmates, Co Employees and BF/GF. This will help the researchers know what type of facilities that will make customers patronize the resort more. The facilities that needed to be added according to the participants are a sports/recreation areas; basketball, volleyball, tennis court as well as billiard hall. Convenience store will likely help the visitors since the area does not have enough stores where customers can purchase petty within the vicinity. Restaurant/catering services will also be helpful since most occasions require food. The resort can also conduct swimming lessons during off season to attract customers. Most participants answered positively when the researchers asked if they will visit again the resort when facilities are develop and improve, specially during off-season.

Specifically, the research aims to determine if the barangays’ operational efficiency, financial accuracy, and asset safeguarding are implemented effectively. To accomplish this, the researchers use data gathered from survey questionnaires answered by various barangay officials from Barangay San Francisco, Barangay Pasong Kawayan II, and Barangay Navarro. Through the data gathered with the use of said questionnaires, the researchers were able to conclude that the operational efficiency, financial accuracy and reliability, and asset safeguarding measures of the barangays are all highly implemented across all three barangays. This is despite the researchers also concluding that imposition of penalties and different employees being in charge of duties such as financial transaction custody, recording, authorization, and buying and disposing of assets, are poorly implemented across all three barangays. As well, the researchers determined that while barangay position and length of service are not significant in assessing internal control measures, educational attainment is significant.",College of Business Administration,"Keywords: Internal Control, Barangay, Barangay Officials",,

Prominent political analysts, Mr. Edmund Tayao and Mr. Ramon Casiple; local government official from the Municipality of Magallanes, Cavite, Ms. Aina Sisante; former professor in University of the Philippines — Visayas, Mr. Hanibal Camua; a Dean of the University of the Philippines National College of Public Administration, Mr. Alex Brillantes; and a national elected official, Senator Pia Cayetano. The results show that the Philippines, under a Unitary government is very highly centralized, and in theory, is not suited for the needs of a diverse country like ours. Changing our system to a Federal system, would empower the local governments which would be a key to standardization in order to meet the basic needs of the people, making it easier for the people to get their needs because the people will be grouped in accordance to their culture and behavior. Hence, a federal government has a bigger probability of fostering good governance compared to unilateral but with the minimum percentage and possibility.

Governments all across the globe grappled with the present resources to curb the spread of the disease by closing down entire economic sectors and imposing widespread restrictions on mobility. This condition has evolved into a major economic crisis which has burdened local businesses. In this study, the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on Tagaytay City's local business particularly on the losses as well as the interventions were examined. Anchoring on the Organizational Adaptation Theory of Podsakoff and MacKenzie (2016), the researcher utilized a qualitative research design to gather data from 10 purposely selected participants who were respective owners of local businesses in Tagaytay. Using the methodological approach of Thomas (2006), the findings revealed that there were notable losses due to the decline in tourism and travel which used to be one of the main sources of income in the city. Furthermore, there was also a significant decrease in the number of customers serviced by different industries; not only due to the imposed lockdown restrictions but also partly in fear of the health risks of acquiring the infection. Hence, the local business had to employ a skeletal workforce and reduce operation hours. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to significant income losses which led businesses to financial stagnation, net deficit, or even bankruptcy and eventual closure. As a result of the study, businesses are recommended to take advantage of e- commerce, as investing in this would considerably assist businesses in recovering since consumers have high preference of online transactions today. Finally, a comprehensive information platform should be implemented by the government to assist individuals who remain unemployed and are still job looking.",College of Arts and Sciences,"Keywords: COVID-19, Local Business",,

The findings of this study revealed that Foreign Service students are competitive and good at time management, which distinguishes the program from other courses, and that the students are also more aware of how the international arena works, which benefits both the students and the company because the students can share the knowledge that they have gained through the company. Although conducting the survey was difficult due to data privacy concerns, respondents were given sufficient assurance that any information they provided would be used solely for the purpose of the study.

Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis were used to test the hypothesis. Findings show that level of job satisfaction has a significant relationship to the level turnover intention and a negative correlation between the two exists while there was no significant relationship found on perceived alternative employment opportunities in correlation to either job satisfaction or turnover intention. The study concludes that job satisfaction alone is a significant predictor of turnover intention and that the interaction with perceived alternative employment opportunities is not significant.

The major determinants of land use change in the study area have been investigated in an attempt to enhance the knowledge of how to provide decision support information for local government analysis on urban and rural areas development. The analysis using GIS and spatial analysis proved to be effective when providing the information base for modelling land use trend in the urban development in the city, to enable informed decisions to be made about land management policies in such areas. The lesson which could be drawn from this study is that a GIS and spatial analysis capacity is useful for local government as a tool in understanding where and why land use change is concentrated, how the pattern of land use has changed, and which areas are susceptible to land use change.

The results revealed that younger generation ages 20 to 25 are more social media Savvy and are frequently engaged in Facebook and website accounts of the hospital as compared to other age brackets. Facebook tends to be more appealing to the majority of the participants primarily due to its status of being the number one social networking site in the world. The importance of having a website must not be taken for granted because it acts as a formal online brochure where current and future clients can gather information about the institution. Of the respondents in both social media accounts, females are more likely to engage in Facebook and website accounts because they are the ones who usually decide for the health of the family and they are more health conscious than males. In this study, majority of the participants in both groups visit the accounts to know more about the hospital and its services, the promos and special offerings and to look for doctors’ clinic schedules. Based on the results of this study, it is concluded that there is no significant difference on the effectiveness of Facebook and website as a whole based on the usefulness of their contents.

The results show that majority of the respondents are aware what pastry goods are; females purchase and consume pastries more than males; males tend to be more satisfied than females. It also prove that demographic profile of the respondents — age, gender, and occupation are not significant in relation to their buying behavior and satisfaction level. On the other hand, the results also show that respondents consider the price of the goods, availability of the goods, accessibility of shops, and the taste of the goods before purchasing and consuming. Meanwhile, the consumer buying behavior and consumer satisfaction are significantly different. Thus, it can be concluded that the consumers consider the price, availability, accessibility, and taste factors before and during the actual purchase. Among the factors, price is the most considered factor, thus, the capacity of the consumers to pay for pastries will depend on their income — high income earners consume pastries regularly, while low income earners, occasionally. It is recommended that entrepreneurs engage in the pastry business formulate strategies on how to lessen the cost of the pastries without sacrificing the quality; as well as the approaches on how to attract consumers on purchasing pastries such as better packaging — by using paper bags and pouches instead of plastic bags or containers to attract environment conscious consumers.

The purpose of this research is to determine the overarching reasons why most of the Philippine Navy officers optionally retire in the active military service despite the good remunerations, benefits and lots of things it offers for the morale and welfare of its officers. The descriptive method was used in this study and survey questionnaires were circulated to the optionally retired regular and reserved officers composed of 56 respondents who after retirement reside in the vicinities of Cavite and Manila areas. The results of the study show that they had no unilateral reasons why they optionally retired from the military service despite the great perks other than the primary factors which gave them primary level of career satisfaction which is salary. Their retirement can be viewed in various perspectives and it is situational for each officer who separated from the profession earlier. Regarding career satisfaction, some officers decided to retire earlier to seek for greener pastures outside the organization, the number 1 reason among the respondents. Based on the survey, their career satisfaction which was primarily attributed to their salary primarily affected their reason to leave the organization early. Others did not view it as a reason affecting their separations. Hence, it can be concluded that the officers retire from the service earlier because of entities outside which they think can utilize their capabilities at maximum level with commensurate compensation compared to that which is within the organization. It is recommended that the younger officers, early in their military profession should have an outlook for their career and condition their minds in doing so because it is their career and a lifetime profession. The institution should always find ways to give attention to its officers and soldiers for their satisfaction. The unit commanders in the area should give professional advice to their younger officers regarding commitment in the service despite the prevalence of good alternative working condition outside the Philippine Navy. After all, their loyalty and commitment are their battle cry when they enter the military profession.",,"Keywords: Anchors away, optional retirement, career satisfaction, Philippine Navy officers",,

The major determinants of land use change in the study area have been investigated in an attempt to enhance the knowledge of how to provide decision support information for local government analysis on urban and rural areas development. The analysis using GIS and spatial analysis proved to be effective when providing the information base for modelling land use trend in the urban development in the city, to enable informed decisions to be made about land management policies in such areas. The lesson which could be drawn from this study is that a GIS and spatial analysis capacity is useful for local government as a tool in where and why land use change is concentrated, how the pattern of land use has changed, and which areas are susceptible to land use change. Better understanding of the results may enhance the capability of local government to predict future land use change, formulate policies and devise more effective land use management strategies.",,"Keywords: Land Use, GIS, Agriculture, Reclassification, Rezoning",,

The relationship was assessed using the variables of the company profile to identify its significance to the level of awareness of cryptocurrency, awareness of the risks involved, and the level of interest in adopting cryptocurrency as a mode of payment for the F&B establishments. The descriptive research design, through the quantitative method, was utilized to assess the level of interest and awareness in cryptocurrency of F&B establishments in the select key cities in Cavite with the highest Internal Revenue Allotment or IRA. The snowball sampling technique was utilized to obtain a total of thirty- three (33) F&B managers and/or owners who became participants of the study. The results show that the participants are aware of cryptocurrencies and the risks involved in their utilization. In terms of adopting cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, the study has shown that these F&B establishment owners and/or managers are not that however, these managers and/or owners are interested in adopting cryptocurrency for the opportunities it can offer for their F&B establishment. Because both are digital in nature, it was also discovered that the type of F&B outlet or establishment, specifically online food delivery shops, has a significant relationship with the level of awareness and the awareness of risks involved in using cryptocurrency. However, there was no significant relationship between the company profile and the level of interest in adopting cryptocurrency for the F&B establishment. It is therefore concluded that despite the general awareness of cryptocurrency, the awareness of the risks involved has affected the perception and interest of the owners and/or managers in adopting cryptocurrency as a mode of payment. With this, it is recommended that a seminar be conducted to further entice and encourage these F&B managers to adopt cryptocurrency as a mode of payment, and that cryptocurrency investors partner with this event as an additional benefit in their cryptocurrency trading and investments.",,"Keywords: awareness, interest, establishments, cryptocurrency, Cavite, online food delivery shops",,

Liquefaction is a phenomena, in which, when a certain layer of soil is subjected to rapid or cyclic loading usually induced by earthquakes, the stiffness and bond strength in soil particles tend to decrease and when the saturated soil experience the shaking the initially low water pressure starts to gradually increase up to the point where the soil particles move with respect to each other. Initial assessment for the potential liquefaction was done through certain variables already present. The variable included in the initial assessment is the liquefaction hazard map provided by the partnership of Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) - DOST and focal government of the province of Cavite. The proximity of the said location to the nearest fault lines is also considered. The valley fault system also commonly known as west valley fault, considered as one of the potential dangerous active fault at present. It has a segment that extends from Dingalan, Aurora up to Canlubang, Laguna and passes through certain areas of Cavite. With this condition presented, the proximity of Tanza National Comprehensive high School to the said active fault is a factor. The assessment is further analyzed with the aid of soil test conducted with the soil samples from the site and the boring logs provided by Department of Public Works and Highways — Cavite I District Engineering Office. The parameters for the assessment of potential liquefaction is gathered and analyzed using Seed and Idriss simplified procedure in assessing potential liquefaction. Therefore the researchers found out that the Tanza National Comprehensive High School (TNCHS) is susceptible to liquefaction having a layer of Silty clay type soil within the Ground Water Table adheres potential liquefaction.

Qualitative method was used in the study and interview was conducted to the 23 municipal/city tourism officers in Cavite. The results showed that the respondents were generally female adults. The participants also declared that there was no formal collection of tourist arrivals in attractions of the province. There are also quality and accessible infrastructures around the area hence, no latest tourism investments were intended to the province. A total of 157 primary tourism resources and 25 potential attractions are also identified on the record. Most of the attractions are maintained by the private sectors while others are under the liability of LGUs. Marketing and promotion are mostly printed materials due to lack of funds but is supported by their marketing partner such as the Provincial tourism office. Hence, it can be concluded that Cavite, due to its rich tourism resources, even though struggling in maintaining and promoting the attractions, still truly draws and continuously attracts not only local but also foreign visitors. It is that tourism officers should maintain and enhance the existing and potential attractions in their area. The linkage between the public and private sector should be strengthened more to have a healthy tourism environment.

The MPLUS software was utilized to test the hypothesis model to measure the relationship, convergence validity, global fit and robustness. The latent adjustment structural equation (LMS ) method was employed to analyze the potential interaction between competition and cooperation intensity, governance mechanism and innovation ability. The effect of four groups of governance mechanisms on innovation capability is dynamically compared. Results showed that the improvement of regional industrial cluster innovation ability depends on the rational use of relationship governance and transaction governance under different co-opetition intensities. When the internal co-opetition intensity is low, the composite mechanism of ' high level transaction governance-low level relationship governance ' is the best configuration scheme. When the internal co-opetition intensity is high, the Council should implement more high-level relationship governance, and the composite mechanism of ' high level relationship governance-transaction governance is the best configuration scheme.",,"Keywords. industrial cluster, competitive cooperation, latent adjustment structural equation, innovation ability, value creation",,

Mendiola Jr.! and Dr.,Abstract,Factors Affecting Cooperative Membership in Cavite: A Basis for an Enhanced Membership Strategy,"As Ikechikwu (2018) noted, the success of a cooperative is in one way or another dependent on the number of its members. This dissertation addresses the question of what affects cooperative membership in Cavite. The 764 participants to this study are cooperative members and non-members. Cooperative member participants were from the top 30 cooperatives in Cavite in terms of membership, while non-members are from the workplaces or communities where the top 30 cooperatives are operating. Data for analyses were collected using a self-made survey and analyzed using binary logistic regression to interpret the independent variables, which are categorical, and the dependent variable, which is binary. Binary logistic regression identified the significant effects and predicted the relationships between variables. The age group of the participants is (17%), and 17 percent belong to the age group 65 percent of the participants are female, and 35 percent are male. In terms of educational attainment, 56 percent of the participants are college graduates. 81 percent of the participants are employed, and 19 percent are self- employed. In terms of monthly income, 32 percent of the participants belong to the income group of The average score accumulated by participants in cooperative knowledge is 7.38, or below average. Cooperative members got an average rating, while non-members mounted up to below average. As to their level of awareness of cooperatives, participants in general were assessed as having moderate awareness of the factors identified. Categorizing the Participant groups, cooperative members were assessed as being extremely aware and non-members as being moderately aware of cooperatives. Findings in marketing and recruitment suggest that cooperative marketing and recruitment activities are often perceived as cooperative by the participants. Cooperative member participants often observe marketing and recruitment, while non-members rarely observe marketing and recruitment. The result of the binary logistic regression reveals that knowledge, level of awareness, age, educational attainment, and monthly income are significantly related to cooperative membership, whereas gender, employment status, and marketing and recruitment are not significantly related to cooperative membership. Notably, the level of awareness has the highest positive impact on cooperative membership. The odds ratio also revealed that the level of awareness increased, for individuals who had a higher level of awareness about approximately by 1,300",,,

For this study, 25 rats weighing 120 - 250g were used. The experimental rats were acclimatized for 7 days and kept under room temperature in a 12-hour light-dark cycle with free access to water ad libitum. After 1 week of acclimatization, the rats had been put into fasting for 8 hours and blood samples were collected using retro-orbital sampling. The baseline blood glucose level of each rat was measured using UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. After measuring the baseline, Diabetes mellitus was induced via intraperitoneal injection of alloxan on each rat. Blood glucose level of each rat was again measured. When they were already hyperglycemic, the rats were grouped into five with five rats each. The first group, also known as the positive group, received Metformin 100 mg/Kg BW. For the second group or the negative group, each rat received 1 mL plain NSS. The third group received 200mg/kg BW; the fourth group received 500mg/kg BW and the last group received 1000mg/kg BW of ethanolic leaf extract of herbstii. All groups received the treatment for seven (7) days once a day every At the 7th day of treatment, blood samples were collected from the rats after they had been put into 8 hours fasting through cardiac puncture to get the value of the fasting blood glucose of all the experimental groups. The result revealed that 200mg/kg BW and BW has no significant difference (p-value<0.05) with the positive group (Metformin) however, 1000mg/kg BW shows that it is significantly more effective in reducing the blood glucose levels of rats than the positive group (Metformin). Results also revealed that there is a significant difference (p-value<0.05) of both the positive and negative groups and 200mg/kg BW of ethanolic leaf extract from their baseline values. In comparison, 500mg/kg BW and 1000mg/kg BW of ethanolic extract of Iresine herbstii showed no significant difference from their baseline value. Furthermore, the values also revealed that there is a significant difference (p-value<0.05) with the fasting blood glucose levels of the experimental groups before and after treatment. Therefore, it is concluded that the ethanolic leaf extract of Jresine herbstii has the ability to reduce and normalize the fasting blood glucose levels of Sprague Dawley Rats.

data_561.jpg,,,,,,,,,,Joy P.  Researchers and Research Adviser *,ABSTRACT,"Hyperacidity was said to be the too much secretion of gastric acid containing hydrochloric acid thus causing an irritating burning sensation in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Hyperacidity can be categorized into two; Primary and Secondary hyperacidity. Aluminum hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide are the most contents of drugs that are available in the market for treating this kind of condition. In relation to this, Cucurbita maxima (kalabasa) seeds have been a potential source of magnesium, manganese, phosphorous, potassium and other elements that are potential for an anti-hyperacidity effect supported by literatures. Meanwhile, simulated stomach model using peristaltic pump was used to determine the anti-hyperacidity effect of Cucurbita maxima and Gaviscon as the standard drug. Cucurbita maxima oil was extracted and were used to formulate emulsion. 10%, 15% and 20% concentrations of both formulated emulsion and Gaviscon were subjected in 2, 1.5 and 1.2pH artificial gastric juice using simulated stomach model. Initial neutralizing effect of both preparations was determined. Formulated emulsion showed weak to intermediate anti-hyperacidity effect while Gaviscon showed an intermediate to strong anti-hyperacidity effect. Peak and duration of action of two preparations were also determined. The results showed that 10%, 15% and 20% concentrations of formulated emulsion have no significant anti-hyperacidity effect within them in 2, 1.5 and 1.2 pH artificial gastric juice. On the other hand, the formulated emulsion with 2 and 1.2 pH has significant difference compared to Gaviscon but has no significant difference in 1.5pH artificial gastric juice.",College of Allied Medical Sciences,"Keywords: Hyperacidity, anti-hyperacidity effect, Cucurbita maxima, Gaviscon, simulated stomach model, artificial gastric juice",,

The interest in this fruit is increasing in many countries, including the Philippines which has a climate ideal for growing different varieties of tropical fruits in general. Several studies showed different uses of H. polyrhizus, but its characteristic of being a good natural stain in semen has not been further studied. The purpose of this study was to determine the betacyanin of alcoholic H. polyrhizus (red dragon fruit) flesh extract as an alternative counter stain for semen smear. This study utilized an experimental comparative design method. Samples were subjected with of 100% methanol in every 100 ml of H. polyrhizus flesh extract and to a series of temperatures: 30°C, 60°C, and 100°C for 5 minutes in the water bath to determine its color stability. This is followed by storing it at low temperature (4°C) without light exposure for 48 hours. The results of this study showed that the pigments were stable at 100°C heat treatment for 5 minutes in water bath and it stained excellently with a rate of 2.48 this signifies that the standard eosin Y-nigrosin and alcoholic H. polyrhizus flesh extract has the same color affinity in staining sperm cells. These initial findings must be further studied in more controlled conditions to determine the stability of Betacyanin. Nevertheless, the result showed that the Betacyanin obtained from the H. polyrhizus flesh extract heated at 100°C is effective as an alternative counterstain for semen smear.",College of Allied Medical Sciences,"Keywords: Hylocereus polyrhizus (red dragon fruit), Betacyanin, Alcoholic extract, Methanol, Eosin Y, Nigrosin, Bioactive component and Seminal smear",,

The public buildings were assessed based on the irregularities observed such as building storey, vertical irregularity, plan irregularity, pre-code, post benchmark, and soil type. Action research method was used in the study and a total of 175 public buildings in Amadeo, Cavite were assessed through Rapid Visual Screening. The results show that in terms of safe evacuation centers, 86 buildings were considered, mainly were the Public Schools and Covered Courts. The remaining 89 buildings were considered unsafe and unfit to be used as an evacuation center when earthquake suddenly happen. Hence, it can be concluded that the majority of the Public Buildings in the municipality dominates the potential seismic hazard and therefore, needs further detailed evaluation from the Provincial Engineering Office. The public buildings inspected scored lower than 2.0 were estimated to have higher risks of damages and collapse when earthquake occur. It is recommended to evaluate private buildings such as residential, commercial and industrial buildings to completely estimate the potential seismic hazard of the municipality and to provide a detailed mapping of the region that has been evaluated to properly visualize the potential hazards in that particular area.","COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, COMPUTER STUDIES AND ARCHITECTURE","Keywords: Amadeo, Cavite, Seismic Hazard, Rapid Visual Screening Procedure, and FEMA Scoring",,

However, the problem in the community is that they are taking advantage of the community by purchasing toys, especially the limited edition and selling them at a much higher price. The community is afraid that, someday, people might not see the true value of toys and might see it to earn money only. The researchers decided to create a Stop Motion that depicts the journey of a toy collector to provide an in-depth exploration for the target audience.

This study explored the lives of the students with BFRB and it aimed to answer the reasons for what triggers a person to engage with BFRB and also to know their coping strategies when they manifest the behavior. The sequential explanatory design was utilized to highlight the quantitative part and to support it with qualitative phase. One hundred (100) participants answered the BFRB pre-survey and Anxiety Questionnaire as part of the quantitative part, while five (5) selected participants were interviewed for the qualitative phase. As a result, the reason why people engage with BFRB is due to the presence of compulsive characteristics. The environment and peer attention are also the reasons in doing the behavior. On the other hand, they do self-evaluation, acceptance, stimulus control and awareness as their coping strategies in order to avoid the behavior. Female participants got a higher percentage (51 than male (49.0), which means that females are more prone to engage with BFRB.

In the quantitative part, it was noted that teenage mothers slightly experienced the struggles during pregnancy and motherhood. teenage mothers experience more of self-oriented adversities during pregnancy while child- oriented adversities during motherhood. Hence, pregnancy and motherhood are indeed two different entities. However, the struggles they experience vary according to various demographic constructs.

Over 12-day experimental period, their larvae were observed under controlled conditions to determine their plastic consumption efficiency. Tenebrio molitor and Zophobas atratus were each divided into three groups, with triplicate samples for each type of plastic: PE, PS, and PP. The study compared the consumption rates of plastics by the larvae. Results showed notable discrepancies in biodegradation abilities between the two species Superworms exhibited higher consumption rates of polystyrene polypropylene (0.40 g), and polyethylene (0.33 g) compared to mealworms, which consumed polystyrene (1.20 g), polypropylene (0.27 g), and polyethylene (0.30 g). The survival rates of both species are similar across various plastic types, except in the case of polypropylene consumption, where Tenebrio molitor exhibited a significantly lower survival rate compared to Zophobas atratus.

Family dynamics include family alignments, hierarchies, roles, ascribed characteristics, and patterns of interactions within a family. Exploring family dynamics with a young person helps individuals understand their behavior and difficulties in context and enables more effective interventions. Being in a separated family is stressful for every individual and can primarily affect negatively the family's children. Some children from a separated family environment grew up as young adults and are found to have complex problems. However, some young adults from separated families are found to be positive and achievers. The purpose of this study was to understand how young adult from separated family achieves resilience. A case study was used in this study. Interviews, protocol and picture prompt were used to collect data. The participants were 18-25-year-olds. Seligman’s 3Ps Model of Resilience was used to understand how the participants achieved resilience. The parents of the participants were mostly separated or absent when the participants were growing up. They had stressors related to lack of openness in communication with parents, lack of role models, lack of mental and emotional support. In this case, the resilience process began when the participants were already teens. The participants' understanding could help them in accepting and coping with the problem actively. It is supported by the internal characteristics, including self-efficacy, perseverance, internal locus of control, coping and adaptation skills, and external support from their social environment.

The research study generally explores the rise of cancel culture on Facebook. Researchers have used qualitative method to further explain the nature of the study. The specific data are gathered in the manner of unstructured interviews, the interviewees namely, two Ph.D. holders in Sociology and Philosophy one Public Relations Practitioner, have produced countless of articles, interviews, and works combined pertaining to Cancel culture. The results showed that the rise of cancel culture on Facebook, has arisen along with how its users maximized online interaction due to the access provided by pervasive networks. active engagement contributes to the cancel culture phenomenon in which everyone finds it easier to express their ideas without repercussions. Facebook is recognized as one of the most successful social media sites. The platform’s algorithms allow users to uncover parallels in their interests, and when these interests are met, users speak their minds. These viral contents attract the most engagement from users because they are not just intrigued but also want to participate. It is concluded that cancel culture rose on Facebook due to Free Facebook, that also instilled disinformation, trolling, and propaganda, Facebook’s complex algorithms create echo chambers which amplifies discourse and differences, and the four most relevant topics that tackle cancel culture are politics, sexual harassment, abuse of power and authority, and racism. It is recommended that a more thorough examination regarding Philippine cancel culture should be done as it is evident that the Western perspective on Cancel Culture has been adapted here. There is more than meets the eye to this, a deeper ground where gold can be found.",College of Arts and Sciences,"Keywords: Cancel Culture, Critical Theory, Discourse, Facebook, Social Media",,

The Balikatan seriés of military exercises is a bilateral Philippines-U.S annual event aimed at improving Republic of the Philippines - United States combined planning, combat readiness and interoperability while enhancing security relations. Through the Balikatan exercises, the U.S. has provided assistance related to enhancing Philippine military capabilities and competencies. It is not the Balikatan exercise series that greatly contribute to the enhancement of Philippines’ Maritime Security but the relationship with the US that increases the Philippines’ sense of security over our maritime issues. Furthermore, with the United States being the dominant naval power, viewed from the Philippines’ perspective, the Philippines do need the support of the US in terms of naval security. In view of these outcomes, this thesis asks how future Balikatan exercises may be conducted in order to to a not just the Security of the Philippines. This thesis argues that the RP-US Balikatan exercise series can be a tool in improving and enhancing the Maritime security of the Philippines by means of professionalizing and enhancing the capability of the Armed Forces of the specifically the Philippine Navy and Marine Corp.

Carilla, MDC 4 and Research",Abstract,"The rapid rise in the usage of Facebook as a means of cultural and social interaction among the indigenous people specifically the Aetas is an intriguing development. It is somehow considered as a phenomenon that has not yet gained a lot of attention in the society, although interest is gaining a momentum as it becomes apparent that the usage of Facebook is becoming a typical activity. This study examines the Facebook usage and its influence and progress among the Aetas to further observe the compatibility of this innovation with the existing traditions, beliefs, and the needs in coping up with the modernization. This study used the Diffusion of Innovations Theory to determine the level of adaptation of the participants on Facebook and the Social Influence Theory to find out the areas in which the participants accepted the new innovation which is Facebook. The researchers used the qualitative approach to attain the objectives of this study. Three Aetas were selected to be interviewed by the researchers using a semi- structured questionnaire. The results showed that Facebook gives them convenience and satisfaction when it comes to their interest in exploring the modern world. They are now on the peak of exploring the modern society and since they are still at the beginning of the new innovation, their culture and tradition is not yet much affected by their Facebook usage. They are still embracing and preserving their way of life although they are already beginning to discover the social media world. Future researchers should further analyze the emergence of other social media platforms in the lives of these indigenous people to address a larger number of participants for more conclusive result.",College of Arts and Sciences,"Keywords: Facebook usage, Aeta",,
